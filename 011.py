Day 6: User Name Generator
Write a function called user_name that generates a username 
from the userâ€™s email. The code should ask the user to input an 
email and the code should return everything before the @ sign 
as their user name. For example, if someone enters 
ben@gmail.com, the code should return ben as their user 
name.
